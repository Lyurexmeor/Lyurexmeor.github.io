            <h5>WHO ARE YOU?</h5>
            <p>
                We donâ€™t just start on a website. We want to get to know your brand first, and we want to know exactly who your audience is so that we can build a strategic concept. When this is done, we start creating a design that we hope is so awesome, it will just make you fall out of your chair! We think about functionality first, while always keeping esthetics and usability in mind. Based on your feedback on the preliminary design, we will finish designing the whole website until every detail has been taken care of. Throughout the process, we will continue to communicate with you so that we reach the perfect end result. If your company is located in Barcelona or the surrounding area, we will meet with you for a midterm work session. Hopefully, all of this is exactly what you are looking for in a design studio. We look forward to hearing more from you!
